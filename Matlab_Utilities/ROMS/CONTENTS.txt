r_in_read.m:  
  - reads variable names and values from the user-specified roms.in file.
  
r_ncgen_bry.m:  
  - generates a 'dummy' boundary conditions forcing NetCDF file with dimensions and variables taken from the specified roms.in and grd.nc files.
  - dummy values are 0 for momentum components, 20 Celsius for temperature, and 32 (units?) for salinity for all time steps specified by roms.in
  - STILL TO ADD: additional tracers, biology variables, sediment variables
  - NOTE: A separate function will be developed to read & write variables from a specified source (e.g., NECOFS hind/forecast)
  - DEPENDENTS: r_ncgen.m, r_nctemplate_bry.m
  
r_ncgen_ini.m:
  - generates a 'dummy' initial conditions NetCDF file with dimensions and variables taken from the specified roms.in and grd.nc files.
  - dummy values are 0 for momentum components, 20 Celsius for temperature, and 32 (units?) for salinity for all time steps specified by roms.in
  - STILL TO ADD: additional tracers, biology variables, sediment variables
  - NOTE: A separate funciton will be developed to read & write variables from a specified source (e.g., Levitus climatology)
  - DEPENDENTS: r_ncgen.m, r_nctemplate_ini.m
  
r_ncgen.m:
  - generates a NetCDF file given a structure containing dimension names and lengths and variable definitions
  
r_nctemplate_bry.m
  - returns a structure containing dimension and variablee names for a ROMS boundary conditions forcing NetCDF file
  
r_nctemplate_ini.m
  - returns a structure containing dimension and variable names for a ROMS initial conditions NetCDF file
